Schema specifications for the Sandpiper Framework API, database, and documents

## About

These are the core specs for the Sandpiper Framework. More documentation and information will be added as we move this from being a behind-the-scenes effort to a fully integrated one.

Please feel free to visit us at https://sandpiperframework.net

## Overview

Four eventual deliverables will live here.

1. [API specification](#api_specification)
1. [Plan Document schema](#plan_document)
1. [Database schema](#database_schema)
1. [Framework documentation](#framework_documention)

Currently we have the API spec, plan document schema, and database schema relatively stable and present in the repository. An out-of-date version of the documentation can be found on the Sandpiper Framework website, and will be merged here with caveats in a separate branch while we update it.
